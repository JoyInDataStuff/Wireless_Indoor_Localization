# Wireless Indoor Localization

## Abstract

My first public project of machine learning models.  It consists in a comparison of different classification algorithms to determine the location of a wireless terminal.  For each of the classification models created different hyperparameters where used.  Then to generate the confusion matrix, the hyperparameters with best score where used.

## Source Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at UCI repository:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wireless+Indoor+Localization
