# Wireless Indoor Localization

## Abstract

My first public project of machine learning models.  It consists in a comparison of different classification algorithms to determine the location of a wireless terminal.  For each of the classification models created different hyperparameters where used.  Then to generate the confusion matrix, the hyperparameters with best score where used.

## Source Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at UCI repository:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wireless+Indoor+Localization

## Description

The different models used in the project are:
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector machine
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting

## Tools and Libraries Used

* pandas                    0.25.1
* numpy                     1.16.5
* matplotlib                3.1.0
* scikit-learn              0.21.3
* seaborn                   0.9.0

## Format

Use of Python 3.7.1 in Jupyter Notebook
